# Predictive Analysis of Wine Quality

## Abstract
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify and predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. By analyzing a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, our goal is to develop a model that can provide insights into the criteria that define high-quality wines, assisting both enthusiasts and professionals in making informed choices.

## Documentation

### Introduction
The project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine using their physicochemical properties. This project aims to apply machine learning to establish criteria for selecting high-quality wine. The motivation behind this study stems from the challenges faced by consumers, particularly amateurs, in discerning high-quality wines among the diverse types available. This project aligns with the goal of providing clear criteria for identifying the best wine.

### Problem Statement
The problem at hand is the difficulty in accurately predicting wine quality due to the multitude of variables involved. Amateur wine consumers often lack a clear framework for assessing quality, which this project addresses by using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes various continuous and categorical variables, such as acidity, sugar, and alcohol content, which affect wine quality. The project's goal is to determine which features are most predictive of wine quality and to develop models that can accurately classify wines based on these features.

### Significance
This problem is significant as it aims to solve a real-world issue for wine enthusiasts and industry professionals. Accurate wine quality prediction could benefit consumers in making informed purchasing decisions and assist producers in quality control. The ability to predict wine quality effectively can benefit producers by improving their product quality, aid retailers in stock selection, and assist consumers in making more informed purchasing decisions. The project uses machine learning to identify predictive features and evaluate different models, including logistic regression, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors, to establish the best approach for wine quality prediction. The projectâ€™s findings, particularly the effectiveness of the random forest classifier, provide insights into how machine learning can improve decision-making in the wine industry.

### Potential Use Cases
- **Wine Producers:** Can use the model to adjust production processes to enhance wine quality.
- **Retailers:** Can better categorize and recommend wines to customers based on quality predictions.
- **Wine Consumers:** Amateur wine enthusiasts can use the model as a guide to selecting wines based on predicted quality rather than price or brand alone.
- **Quality Control Labs:** Labs can adopt the model to perform routine quality checks and ensure compliance with quality standards.

## Setup
In this project, we utilized a red wine quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 1,599 instances, each featuring 12 attributes related to wine quality, such as acidity, sugar, and alcohol content. The dataset includes a quality rating, which serves as the output variable for our predictive models. The data was split into training and test sets in an 80/20 ratio, and outliers were removed using box plots to ensure the dataset's integrity. 

The experimental setup focused on three models: logistic regression with best subset selection, random forest classifier, and k-nearest neighbors. We employed cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing parameters for each model to maximize accuracy and other performance metrics. The project was conducted using Python-based libraries on a standard computing setup, allowing us to explore and evaluate different models effectively. The models were selected based on their ability to address the problem at hand, considering key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It comprises physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables based on physicochemical tests. The dataset has two sets, one for red wine and one for white wine. Each set contains variables such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality. The 'quality' variable is a score between 0 and 10 given by human experts.

- **Number of Instances:** 1599 for red wine and 4898 for white wine.
- **Number of Attributes:** 12 per set, including the output attribute (quality).
- **Basic Statistics:** Detailed statistics including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for each attribute are to be provided in this section.

### Experimental Setup
The models planned for evaluation include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forests, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). For each model, the following setups will be considered:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Parameters such as 'n_neighbors' and the distance metric will be tuned to optimize performance.
- **Random Forests:** Parameters like the number of trees, depth of the trees, and the number of features to consider for the best split will be tuned.
- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA):** Focus will be on assessing the assumptions of normal distributions within the feature set.

Each model will undergo a rigorous validation process, likely employing techniques such as cross-validation and various performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, etc.). 

### Computing Environment
The experiments will be conducted using Python, specifically leveraging libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for data visualization. Execution will primarily occur on local machines or cloud-based platforms, depending on the computational resources required.

### Problem Setup
- **Modeling Details for Neural Networks (TBD):** If neural network models are considered later, details about the network structure, number of layers, activation functions, and optimizer choices will be included here.


### Methodology (TBD)

### Results and Discussion (TBD)
In conclusion, the project successfully demonstrated the potential of machine learning for predicting red wine quality based on physicochemical properties. Among the models evaluated, the random forest classifier stood out as the most reliable, achieving the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This model's strength lies in its ability to handle feature interactions, its robustness against overfitting, and its capacity to capture non-linear relationships, all of which are critical for accurate wine quality prediction. The analysis revealed that alcohol, sulphates, and volatile acidity are the top three features that could serve as criteria when choosing high-quality wine.

The findings highlight how machine learning can enhance decision-making in the wine industry, benefiting both producers and consumers. By leveraging predictive modeling, the project provides a robust framework for establishing clear criteria for identifying high-quality wines, thereby addressing the challenges faced by amateur wine consumers and improving the overall wine selection process.
