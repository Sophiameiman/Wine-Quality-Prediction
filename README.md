# Predictive Analysis of Wine Quality

## Abstract
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify and predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. By analyzing a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, our goal is to develop a model that can provide insights into the criteria that define high-quality wines, assisting both enthusiasts and professionals in making informed choices.

## Documentation

### Introduction
The consumption and interest in wine have grown globally, presenting a challenge for consumers and sellers in distinguishing wine quality. This project aims to apply machine learning algorithms to identify and predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. We use a comprehensive dataset that includes variables such as acidity, sugar, pH levels, and alcohol content, which are indicative of wine's overall quality.

### Problem Statement
The primary challenge is to predict the quality of wine using objective measurements rather than subjective taste tests. The dataset provides several physicochemical features that require analysis to understand their impact on the final quality rating of the wine.

### Significance
This problem is of particular interest because the wine industry represents a significant economic sector with a wide range of products. The ability to predict wine quality effectively can benefit producers by improving their product quality, aid retailers in stock selection, and assist consumers in making more informed purchasing decisions.

### Potential Use Cases
- **Wine Producers:** Can use the model to adjust production processes to enhance wine quality.
- **Retailers:** Can better categorize and recommend wines to customers based on quality predictions.
- **Wine Consumers:** Amateur wine enthusiasts can use the model as a guide to selecting wines based on predicted quality rather than price or brand alone.
- **Quality Control Labs:** Labs can adopt the model to perform routine quality checks and ensure compliance with quality standards.

## Setup

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It comprises physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables based on physicochemical tests. The dataset has two sets, one for red wine and one for white wine. Each set contains variables such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality. The 'quality' variable is a score between 0 and 10 given by human experts.

- **Number of Instances:** 1599 for red wine and 4898 for white wine.
- **Number of Attributes:** 12 per set, including the output attribute (quality).
- **Basic Statistics:** Detailed statistics including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for each attribute are to be provided in this section.

### Experimental Setup
The models planned for evaluation include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forests, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). For each model, the following setups will be considered:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Parameters such as 'n_neighbors' and the distance metric will be tuned to optimize performance.
- **Random Forests:** Parameters like the number of trees, depth of the trees, and the number of features to consider for the best split will be tuned.
- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA):** Focus will be on assessing the assumptions of normal distributions within the feature set.

Each model will undergo a rigorous validation process, likely employing techniques such as cross-validation and various performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, etc.). 

### Computing Environment
The experiments will be conducted using Python, specifically leveraging libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for data visualization. Execution will primarily occur on local machines or cloud-based platforms, depending on the computational resources required.

### Problem Setup
- **Modeling Details for Neural Networks (TBD):** If neural network models are considered later, details about the network structure, number of layers, activation functions, and optimizer choices will be included here.
